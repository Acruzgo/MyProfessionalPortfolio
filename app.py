    **SQL Business Analytics Project ‚Äì Tulane University (MBA Program)**  
    This project was developed as part of an MBA-level SQL course, simulating a real-world business scenario involving client behavior, subscription tiers, and employee performance. Using Microsoft SQL Server, I created normalized schemas, imported and cleaned datasets, and built logic-driven queries to extract actionable insights.

    **Key Highlights:**
    - Designed and populated relational schemas using `CREATE TABLE`, `BULK INSERT`, and foreign keys
    - Wrote complex queries to answer business questions across client segmentation, sales attribution, and operational performance
    - Built dynamic views and stored procedures for employee-specific reporting
    - Joined datasets across multiple schemas (App, HR, Restaurant) and used `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, `UNION`, `HAVING`, and aggregation logic
    - Delivered 10+ insights on clients, cities, coffee sales, device usage, and subscription revenue

    **Tools Used:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Snowflake-compatible syntax
